<p> HISTORY OF THE INTERNET The Internet has its origins in the Cold War. In 1957, the Soviet Union launched the first satellite, Sputnik. In response, the United States created the Advanced Research Projects Agency, or ARPA. The plan emerged to create a communication network that would not be vulnerable to a nuclear attack In 1969, ARPA awarded contracts for the development of the arpanet project, which adopted packet switching technology. The network of Interface Message Processors was built, and the host-to-host protocol was specified by a group of graduate students at UCLA. Arpanet adopted packet switching technology, connecting computers across the United States and eventually reaching the United Kingdom and Norway In the 1970s, other packet-switched networks emerged where there was a simplified end-to-end approach to internetworking, where it was put into practice. The development behind Ethernet and PARC Universal Packet was developed by BOB later on . In 1974 , a published research that evolved into the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP)â€”two critical protocols of the Internet suite .These protocols allowed multiple separate networks to be joined into a network of networks. Due to Continued growth of social media and online communities Emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) connects everyday objects to the Internet and AI which continues to evolve each day In conclusion the internet has transformed how we live, communicate, and collaborate.From booking airline tickets to streaming music and watching movies, the Internet is an essential part of our lives.Billions of people worldwide use it daily, making it a vital part of our economy and society Research done by:    ASHER
